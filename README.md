# Trump 6 January Speech Picture Wordcloud
I saw a wordcloud of US president Joe Biden's inauguration speech today and simply couldn't resist the temptation to create another one of Donald Trump's speech from 6 January to highlight the contrast. ;)

## Installation
The notebook uses Python 3 and the [WordCloud](https://amueller.github.io/word_cloud/) library.
